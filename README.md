# Web-Scrape-Wikipedia
This script performs Web Scraping on a Wikipedia page that lists the largest companies in the United States by revenue. Using the BeautifulSoup and requests libraries, the script accesses the page, extracts the table with company information, and organizes the data into a pandas DataFrame. The result can be saved to a CSV file for further analysis.
